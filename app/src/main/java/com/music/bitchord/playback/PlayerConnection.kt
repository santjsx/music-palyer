 * a second: every tab, both floating bars, and the three real-time blurs
 * underneath them, whether or not anything on screen showed a position.
 *
 * Split out and held behind a stable object, the tick is a read of this alone.
 * Whoever draws a scrubber reads it and recomposes; nobody else hears about it.
 * Take care to keep it that way — reading [positionMs] high in the tree and
