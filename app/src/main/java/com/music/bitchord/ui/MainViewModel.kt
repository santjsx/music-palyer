     * The library feed's Playlists shelf, rewritten by [edit].
     *
     * Every playlist edit has to do this by hand, because the library tab reads
     * `_library` and nothing else — [playlists] is the picker's list, not the
     * tab's — so a rename that only updated that list left the card on screen
     * still bearing the old name.
     *
     * Re-fetching instead is what this replaces, and it did not work: YouTube's
     * `FEmusic_liked_playlists` is eventually consistent, and a fetch fired the
     * moment an edit returns reliably answers with the state from *before* it.
     * So the edit was applied, the feed denied it, and the denial is what
     * reached the screen — the bug this exists to fix. The re-fetch still
     * happens, via [libraryStale], once the tab is next opened and the feed has
     * caught up.
     *
     * A shelf that isn't there yet is created by [edit] returning rows for it
     * (a first playlist has no shelf to add to), and one left empty is dropped —
     * see [LibraryScreen], which draws the create tile with or without a shelf.
