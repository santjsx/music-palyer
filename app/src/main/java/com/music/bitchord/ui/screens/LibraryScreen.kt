/**
 * The way in to Replay, at the top of the page.

 * is — a view of what is already yours, alongside the playlists and the
 * downloads. A fifth tab would give a page most people open a handful of times
 * a year the same standing as Search.
 *
 * ## Why it is painted the way the cards are
 *
 * The mesh is the same one the Replay cards and the player's backdrop run —
 * sampled from the artwork of the record the period was mostly spent on, and
 * drifting rather than settling (see [MeshGradientBackground]'s `continuous`).
 * A fixed brand gradient here looked like a promo banner, which is the one thing
 * this must not be: it advertises the user's own listening, so it should be lit
 * by the user's own listening, and it should not look like anything else on the
 * page. With nothing played yet the mesh falls back to its stock colours, which
 * is a perfectly good button and still not a red rectangle.
 *
 * A single wide strip rather than a shelf of cards: there is exactly one of it,
 * and a carousel with one item in it always reads as a carousel that failed to
 * load the rest.
