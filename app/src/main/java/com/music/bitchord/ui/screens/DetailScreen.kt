 *  2. [MergeBand] — one pane of glass laid across the join, blurring layer 1.
 *  3. The list — titles, buttons and rows, drawn over the glass and so sharp.
 *
 * Blurring only the artwork leaves the artwork and the page as two surfaces
 * that have been made to *resemble* each other, and the eye finds that edge
 * every time. A single blur that samples across the join has no edge to find:
 * the picture, the colour under it and the colour under the song rows are all
 * one smear of the same glass. It is the same thing [TopFadeBlur] does to the
 * head of the screen, pointed at the middle of this one.
