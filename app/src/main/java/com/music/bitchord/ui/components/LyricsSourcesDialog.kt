/**
 * Which lyric databases the player is allowed to ask.
 *
 * Same frosted iOS alert as [UpdateAvailableDialog], down to the shared
 * [ALERT_WIDTH]/[ALERT_CORNER] metrics and hairline [AlertRule]s, with the
 * action rows swapped for checkable ones. Checkmarks rather than Material
 * checkboxes: that is what a multiple-selection list looks like in this
 * lineage, and a column of square boxes would be the one Material thing left
 * on an otherwise Apple-shaped alert.
 *
 * The order shown is the order they are tried, and it is the user's to set:
 * drag a row by its handle to move it, which reorders independently of
 * whether the row is ticked — priority and participation are different
 * questions, and this is the one dialog for both.

/**
 * How far past a neighbour the finger has to carry a row before the two trade
 * places, as a share of one row's pitch.
 *
 * Deliberately more than half. At exactly half, a row that has just swapped
 * lands with its offset sitting precisely on the boundary of swapping *back* —
 * so a single pixel of the shake any real finger has flipped it, and the
 * compensating shift put it straight back on the forward boundary again. The
 * row juddered between two slots for as long as it was held near a crossing,
 * which is the "loops up and down in the same position" this fixes. Anything
 * over half opens a gap between the two boundaries; a tenth of a row is enough
 * to swallow the shake without the swap feeling reluctant.
