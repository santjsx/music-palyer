 * like a tenth of its blur left there — enough to leave a heavy 30sp title
 * looking soft before it had been scrolled anywhere. The tail is what hides the
 * layer's end, so it cannot simply be cut; 88 is as short as it goes before the
 * ramp starts to be findable. The rest of the clearance is bought by starting
 * the page's content lower — the two are tuned against each other, and neither
