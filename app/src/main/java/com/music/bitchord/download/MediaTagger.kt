/**
 * Embeds title, artist, album, lyrics and cover art into a track [Downloads]
 * just finished saving, so it reads correctly in a file manager or another
 * player rather than only inside this app, where the filename is otherwise
 * the only thing carrying that.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout, deliberately: the cover fetch is a network call
 * that can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the download that
 * already succeeded, and [Mp4Tagger], [WebmTagger] and [FlacTagger] all fall
 * back to returning their input unchanged on anything they don't recognise.
 * Every step here is caught rather than left to propagate, because a download
 * this runs after has already landed — a tagging failure should cost the tags,
 * not the file.
 *
 * The lyrics are the one thing not fetched here. They come in as text from
 * [LyricsTag], started by [Downloads] early enough to overlap the transfer,
 * because that lookup races four services and is the one piece of this worth
 * not paying for in wall-clock time after the last byte has landed.
