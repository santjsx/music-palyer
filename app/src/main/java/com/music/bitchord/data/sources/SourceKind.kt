/**
 * The kinds of source this build knows how to talk to.
 *
 * Fixed and small on purpose. **Declaration order here is the order sources
 * are tried** — see `SourceRegistry.active()`, which sorts on `kind.ordinal` —
 * so a custom module comes before the built-in one, then JioSaavn, then
 * YouTube Music. Adding a source means adding a [MusicSource] implementation
 * and an entry here, which is the point — every protocol the app speaks is one
 * someone can read in this repo, and a source can't teach the app a new way to
 * behave after it ships.
 *
 * What varies per *instance* — which index, whose module — is [SourceConfig].

     * and hands back a stream URL in about 0.4s, while a module index takes
     * 7-13s to walk its backends — and read-ahead runs on the track *after* the
     * one playing, so a lookup that slow is usually still going when the
     * listener arrives. A wasted JioSaavn resolve costs one HTTP round trip; a
     * wasted module resolve costs a QuickJS engine, an index fetch and several
     * backend searches. The first is worth spending speculatively and the
     * second is not.
     *
     * False for [YOUTUBE] as well, though it *is* warmed ahead of time — that
     * happens through its own read-ahead in
     * [AudioCache][com.music.bitchord.playback.AudioCache], which speaks video
     * ids directly and needs no cross-source match to find the track.
